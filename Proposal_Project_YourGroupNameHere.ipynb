    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "One of the major ethical concerns associated with AI chess bots, such as the one we are developing for this project, is their role in facilitating cheating. The accessibility of powerful engines like Stockfish has led to widespread dishonesty in online chess and, in some cases, even professional tournaments. With these tools readily available, players can gain an unfair advantage, undermining the integrity of competitions and diminishing the skill-based nature of the game. If left unchecked, AI-assisted cheating could erode trust in online platforms and threaten the credibility of chess as a competitive sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond cheating, the dominance of AI in chess raises concerns about the balance between human skill and technological assistance. Players who rely too heavily on AI for training and move analysis may experience diminished critical thinking and strategic development. While AI can be a valuable tool for improvement, excessive dependence could lead to a generation of players who prioritize engine-generated moves over their own creative play. This shift not only affects individual growth but also alters the broader landscape of competitive chess, where originality and deep positional understanding risk being overshadowed by algorithmic precision."
